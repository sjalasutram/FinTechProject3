Project SurWei - Alice Abillu, Sreedhar Jalasutram, Jacob Shields


## Project Overview
Project SurWei involves in creating the Survey, distributing the survey to a group of respondents and recording the respondentsâ€™ responses on the Ethereum blockchain. A surveyor generates a survey and records the survey as a Smart Contract on the block chain. The address of the Smart Contract is then distributed to the respondents. The respondents access the survey (smart contract) and record their responses to the questions listed in the survey. After responding to the survey, the smart contract will record the survey responses on the block chain as a transaction. At the end of the survey, the surveyor can review the list of responses.

## Project Features and Objectives
1. Survey Generator : Using a factory pattern, the smart contract generates surveys on-demand

2. Responding to a Survey: A mechanism where users on the blockchain could respond to a survey

3. Publishing Survey Results: A report of the survey, question and choices, and the responses recorded on that survey

4. Develop user interface to facilitate survey creation


## Libraries and Technologies Used

Solidity
Python
Pandas 
MetaMask browser extension
Ganashe 
web3 
NumPy


## Conclusion
This project required a combination of blockchain technolog and decentralized applications (dApps) to build a dynamic survey app to facilitate survey creation, to provide access to a specific survey and responses  which can pave way to real time analytics reporting on the survey responses.
